              Midterms can feel impossible when projects, quizzes, and group
              work all hit at the same time. This guide breaks everything into
              small, manageable steps so you can stay calm and still get the
              grades you want.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>1. Map out all exam dates and deadlines</h2>
          <p>
            Start by listing every exam, quiz, and project deadline in one
            place. Use a weekly calendar and highlight the most important
            subjects. When everything is visible, you can plan realistic study
            sessions.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Use short, focused study blocks</h2>
          <p>
            Instead of trying to study for 5 hours non-stop, break it into 25–40
            minute blocks with short breaks. This keeps your brain fresh and
            helps you remember more.
          </p>

          <div class="info-box">
            <strong>Tip:</strong> Focus on past papers, lecture slides, and your
            teacher’s review sessions. These usually give strong hints about
            what appears in the exam.
          </div>

          <h2>3. Prioritize high-impact topics</h2>
          <p>
            If a chapter is worth 30% of the exam, spend more time there. Don’t
            waste energy memorizing every tiny detail that might not even
            appear.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Take care of your body</h2>
          <p>
            Sleep, water, and simple food are more important than you think.
            All-nighters look cool but usually give you lower performance in the
            exam room.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Use your friends – smartly</h2>
          <p>
            Group study can help when you divide topics, teach each other, and
            share clear summaries. Just be careful that the “study” group
            doesn’t become a chatting group.
          </p>
